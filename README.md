# Hardware Learning Lab – PCB Design & Signal Analysis Projects

This repository is a collection of hands-on hardware projects focused on learning practical PCB design and signal analysis. It documents the full workflow from initial schematics and simulations through PCB layout, fabrication files, bring-up notes, and measurement results for each project. The goal is to build intuition for real-world behavior—parasitics, noise, grounding, and signal integrity—rather than just producing “perfect” textbook circuits.

Each project includes design files, brief writeups of design decisions, test setups, and lessons learned so that others can follow along, replicate the work, or adapt the designs for their own experiments. Over time, this lab will expand to cover topics like analog front-ends, microcontroller boards, filtering, and basic high-speed signal considerations, forming a growing reference for self-directed hardware learners.
